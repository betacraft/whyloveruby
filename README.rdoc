It's an attempt to collect ideas and love for ruby. I hope this would give some real good insights to ruby, as well as some people will get very good pointers to defend ruby while fighting others supporting other languages.

If you have some idea, suggestion or anything, do post it or submit a pull request. Create an issue and discuss features before pull requests :-)

Do checkout few awesome current reasons on this site, as well as do post your own reasons !

Cheers !!
