      # one problem with continuing to use this long term would be:
      #   - if a user changes their profile picture, the url saved on our model will become invalid
      #      we do have a fallback to default image in place, but it's not ideal
      #   - As an improvement, we can try to cache it (more like a permanent snapshot until their next login)
      #   - But a proper solution would be to fetch their current profile picture via a service or to periodically refresh it ourself
